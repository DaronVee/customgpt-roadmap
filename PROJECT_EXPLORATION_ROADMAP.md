# Project Exploration Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the planned exploration and enhancement goals for the CustomGPT Roadmap application. The project aims to leverage cloud deployment, visual testing automation, and UI improvements through modern development practices.

## üéØ Exploration Goals

### 1. Cloud Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Deploy the roadmap app to Render with automated GitHub integration

**Objectives**:
- Set up Render cloud deployment configuration
- Configure GitHub repository for auto-deployment triggers
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for seamless development workflow
- Ensure environment variables and build processes are properly configured

**Key Deliverables**:
- Working Render deployment
- GitHub Actions or Render auto-deploy setup
- Production-ready build configuration

### 2. MCP Server Integration (Playwright)
**Goal**: Install and configure Playwright MCP server for visual testing capabilities

**Objectives**:
- Research and install Playwright MCP server
- Configure Claude Code to access Playwright functionality
- Enable visual UI testing and inspection capabilities
- Test MCP integration with the roadmap application

**Key Deliverables**:
- Functional Playwright MCP server setup
- Claude Code integration for visual testing
- Documentation of MCP installation process

**Learning Opportunity**:
This serves as a practical exploration of MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation and usage patterns.

### 3. UI Enhancement & Visual Development
**Goal**: Improve application UI, navigation, and user interactions using cloud-deployed environment

**Objectives**:
- Analyze current UI/UX patterns and identify improvement areas
- Enhance navigation flow and user interaction elements
- Implement responsive design improvements
- Use Playwright (via MCP) for visual regression testing
- Leverage cloud deployment for real-time UI testing and iteration

**Key Deliverables**:
- Enhanced user interface with improved navigation
- Better user interaction patterns
- Visual regression testing setup
- Documented UI/UX improvements

**Development Approach**:
- Work on cloud-deployed version through GitHub integration
- Use Playwright MCP for visual feedback and testing
- Implement iterative improvements with automated visual validation

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

The three goals are designed to work synergistically:

1. **Deploy to Render** ‚Üí Provides stable cloud environment for testing
2. **Setup Playwright MCP** ‚Üí Enables visual testing and UI inspection
3. **Enhance UI** ‚Üí Leverages both cloud deployment and visual testing for optimal development experience

## üìã Next Steps

- [ ] Research Render deployment requirements for Node.js/Express apps
- [ ] Investigate Playwright MCP server installation process
- [ ] Audit current UI for improvement opportunities
- [ ] Plan GitHub repository structure for CI/CD integration

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Context

**Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
**Current State**: Local development environment with basic roadmap functionality
**Target State**: Cloud-deployed application with visual testing capabilities and enhanced UI
